# ECE-128-Lab-4
The purpose of this lab was to use combinational logic to design and implement a safety interlock and warning system in a modern car. The system evaluated multiple inputs representing realistic factors in a vehicle to provide outputs that represent warning signals. Ultimately, by using combinational logic, the system evaluates, based on input criteria, if the engine is permitted to start. By using combinational logic, the system operates without memory elements or clock behavior, and the design demonstrates how the logical relationships between the input signals can be correlated. Additionally, the combinational logic highlights the usefulness of a truth table in implementing a design with multiple inputs and parameters. 1.) In the constraint dropdown add the constraint file 2.) Compile project: Create 1 .vfiles and copy the top_carwarning 3.) Make top_carwarning the top file in the hierarchy 4.) Run these steps 5.) Generate Bitstream 6.) Copy the TB4 to test code before programming the FPGA board 7.) Program the board
